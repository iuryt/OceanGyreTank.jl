# WeatherTank.jl

I haven't done that only because I don't have enough time now, but my plan is to dedicate some of my time to simulate all [Weather in a Tank](http://weathertank.mit.edu) simulations on Oceananigans. I think that this could be a very nice "tutorial" because the theory is covered by Marshall and Plumb's book alongside with laboratory experiments, but my idea is to build a hands-on course on Physical oceanography on which the students learn the theory, laboratory and modeling.
